**Freatures**

**Traffic Object Detection**
Detects vehicles in images or video streams using CNN-based models (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).

Real-time or batch processing supported.

**Vehicle Classification**
Classifies detected vehicles into categories like car, bus, truck, and motorcycle.

Leverages transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).

**Traffic Volume Estimation**
Counts vehicles across predefined zones or lines over time.

Supports both frame-wise and region-based volume aggregation.

**Input Support**-
Accepts real-time traffic camera feeds or pre-recorded video files.

Supports image sequences and single-frame inference.

**Data Preprocessing**
Image normalization, resizing, and augmentation (e.g., flipping, cropping).

Support for COCO, Pascal VOC, or custom annotation formats.

**Model Framework**
Built using PyTorch (or TensorFlow) for training and inference.

Exportable to ONNX or TorchScript for deployment.

**Evaluation Metrics**
Object detection: mAP (mean Average Precision)

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Volume estimation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Post-Processing**
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine detection outputs.

Optional object tracking using SORT or Deep SORT for accurate volume counting.
